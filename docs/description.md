# Overview

This block takes precomputed PCA embeddings clustering assignments from upstream blocks and calculates a pseudotime trajectory, a measure of each cell's progression along a biological process like differentiation. It outputs a pseudotime value per cell and visualizes the results with UMAP and violin plots.
